# Computational Neuroscience #

The second project has 2 parts. The first part is designed for you to numerically simulate the Moris Lecar Equations (MLE) and perform phase plane analysis. In the second part, the project builds on the  MLE  to simulate Hodgkin Huxley (HH) equations and then simulations of other HH type models of neurons.
